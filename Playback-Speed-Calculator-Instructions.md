### Mathematical Formula

The Playback Speed Calculator works by using simple math to figure out how long it will take to finish your audio or video at a certain speed. Here’s how it does that:

**Total Length (in seconds):**
We first convert the total time of your audiobook or video into seconds. The formula is:

```
Total Length (seconds) = (Hours × 3600) + (Minutes × 60) + Seconds
```

**Listening Time:**
To calculate the new time at your selected speed, we use this formula:

```
Listening Time (seconds) = Total Length (seconds) / Playback Speed
```

**Time Saved:**
If you choose a faster speed, you'll save time. The formula for time saved is:

```
Time Saved (seconds) = Total Length (seconds) − Listening Time (seconds)
```

### Example

Let’s say your audiobook is 2 hours, 30 minutes, and 0 seconds long, and you choose to listen at 1.5x speed:

**Total Length (seconds):**
(2 × 3600) + (30 × 60) + 0 = 9000 seconds

**Listening Time (seconds):**
9000 / 1.5 = 6000 seconds = 1 hour, 40 minutes, 0 seconds

**Time Saved (seconds):**
9000 − 6000 = 3000 seconds = 50 minutes, 0 seconds

So, by listening at 1.5x speed, you’ll finish the audiobook in 1 hour and 40 minutes and save 50 minutes.
